# Guaki

Due to the need to promote healthy eating in the post-pandemic world, this project focuses on the development and planning of an innovative application named "Guaki" dedicated to promoting healthy eating. The application aims to facilitate users in making informed decisions about their dietary habits by providing detailed information on the nutritional value of foods, suggestions for healthy meals, and balanced recipes. Through a methodically planned development strategy, the goal has been to integrate intuitive and appealing features that enhance the user experience. This abstract emphasizes the project's commitment to promoting a healthy lifestyle through technology and underscores the importance of effective management in the development of the "Guaki" app.
